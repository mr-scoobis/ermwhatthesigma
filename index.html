            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the recreation of human intelligence imported into computers. Since its mid-20th century origins with pioneers like Alan Turing, AI's popularity skyrocketed. It endured periods of excitement known as AI summers and skepticism also known as AI winters. But breakthroughs in machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning were able to completely revive AI, allowing us to create "intelligence" that is able to handle tasks like language processing, audio processing, and image recognition.</p>
            <p>AI now revolutionizes industries from healthcare to finance with increased efficiency. However, it raises ethical concerns about bias and societal impact that require us to consider ways to make AI safer. Despite challenges, AI's future looks promising.</p>
            <p>Today, I will be diving into AI's history, milestones, opportunities, and obstacles, providing insights into its profound societal influence and trajectory.<p>
